"""
One-time importer: repo_5.xlsx (flat path/link rows) -> data/tree.json.

Produces the same {nodes, links} shape the real Supabase schema exposes
(nodes: id/name/node_type/parent_id/sort_order, links: id/node_id/
link_kind/url/title), so local_client.py can serve it with the exact
function signatures supabase_client.py used to hit over HTTP.

Run once (or whenever repo_5.xlsx changes):
    python tools/import_content.py [path/to/repo_5.xlsx]

Cleaning rules (silent skip, no report file):
  - A row is usable only if it has both a url and a link_kind. Rows
    missing either (structural/blank spacer rows, path-only rows with
    no link) are dropped without comment.
  - link_kind is case- and separator-normalized: "drive_Notes" and
    "drive-Notes" both become "drive_notes"; "youtube" stays "youtube";
    anything else unrecognized is dropped.
  - Class Title is forward-filled *within* each path group before
    filtering, because the source data only carries the title on the
    first of each (youtube / drive_notes / drive_questions) triplet.
  - Node tree levels come from the path's own segment count (7 in this
    file: University/Faculty/Department/Year/Semester/CourseUnit/leaf-
    marker) rather than a hardcoded 8, so the importer doesn't silently
    mis-shape a future file with a different depth.

Round 3 addition: a url that's present (so the row isn't dropped by the
rule above) but doesn't start with http:// or https:// is still
imported as-is -- this importer has no way to know if a differently-
shaped value is a typo or intentional -- but is now also collected and
printed as a warning list after the import summary, so a url that's
obviously never going to open or embed doesn't have to be found by
clicking through the app first. This does NOT catch a url that's a
well-formed http(s) address but points somewhere dead, unshared, or
otherwise inaccessible -- that's a live-content problem no static check
on the spreadsheet can catch; see the Viewer's own fallback handling
for that case instead.
