"""
Raw tree access over the local JSON file --- the local equivalent of the
"Raw tree access (used internally by the shims below)" section of
supabase_client.py, plus the two _node_to_*/_link_to_* reshaping
functions from that file (made public here since local_client.py and
tools/import_content.py both need them, and there's no module-private
convention worth enforcing across a two-file local package).

Loaded once per Streamlit session via @st.cache_resource --- data/tree.json
is small (24 nodes / 157 links from the current repo_5.xlsx import) and
read-only at runtime, so caching avoids re-parsing it on every rerun
without needing any actual database engine.

Three additions beyond the original build:
  - youtube_video_id() --- extracts the 11-char video id from a
    youtube.com/watch?v=... url, for embedding (see local_client.py's
    docstring for why embedding needed this at all).
  - drive_embed_url() --- round 3 addition, same purpose as
    youtube_video_id() but for drive_notes/drive_questions links:
    turns a docs.google.com or drive.google.com url into the matching
    Google /preview (or /embed, for Slides) address the Viewer can
    point an iframe at, instead of the static placeholder box those
    file types fell into before. Returns None on a url that doesn't
    match a recognized Google Docs/Drive shape --- the same "didn't
    match" contract youtube_video_id() already uses --- which is not
    the same thing as the url being dead; this function only looks at
    the url's shape, never fetches it.
  - links_for_node_grouped() --- the source spreadsheet's "leaf" level
    is a single literal "Class" node per course unit (see
    tools/import_content.py's docstring), so every link for e.g.
    Pathophysiology --- 14+ of them across Epilepsy, Meningitis, Stroke,
    etc --- shares one node_id. The tree structure alone can't tell them
    apart; only each link's own `title` field (forward-filled from the
    source's "Class Title" column) can. This groups by that field so
    Course Detail can render topic sub-sections instead of one flat
    unlabeled pile.
  - search() rewritten to be hierarchy-aware: it now tags each node hit
    with which level matched (faculty/department/course_unit/etc, per
    Data_Model_and_retrieval_Complexity.docx's named hierarchy levels)
    and each link hit with its resource kind, instead of returning two
    undifferentiated flat lists.
