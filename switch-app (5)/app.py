# skips straight to Home, silently, with no re-prompt --- that's the
# literal "access for up to three days without logging" ask. Only a
# missing/unknown/expired session falls through to the sign-up/login
# gate, which is also the literal "prompting them to sign up on opening
# platform" ask --- it's shown on open, not on every navigation, because
# this check only runs once here in app.py, not on every page.
